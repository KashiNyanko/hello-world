# hello-world
An entry learning project to get started with Git

Hello world! I'm Ting, currently an Info Systems student, a coding hobbyist, and a gamer. I'm into art, music, coding, reading, gaming, and anything in between. This is a simple and traditional "Hello World" project for me to get started with Git.
